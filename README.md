<!--
I am experienced in developing and maintaining testing procedures to ensure company product standards are satisfied.

My day to day work involves conducting quality tests, performing inspection checks, setting product configurations, and communicating test results via thorough documentation.

While not in school or working, I am currently enrolled in data camps to further improve my data analytics skills. Some tools I have used to gather and clean data have been SQL, python, and excel.
